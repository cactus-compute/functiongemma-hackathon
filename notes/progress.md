# Progress — Goal 2: End-to-End Product Demo

## Current State: Planning
See `notes/goal2.md` for full details and ideas.

## Context
Goal 1 is done (89.15% on leaderboard). Now we need a hacky but functional Python demo showing real-world use of hybrid routing. Judges score on:
- **Rubric 1**: Quality of hybrid routing — depth and cleverness
- **Rubric 2**: End-to-end products that execute function calls to solve real-world problems
- **Rubric 3**: Low-latency voice-to-action products, leveraging `cactus_transcribe`

## Iteration History

## Decisions Made

## What We Have From Goal 1
- `main-4.py` — robust hybrid routing (89.15% on hidden eval)
- Working Cactus + FunctionGemma setup
- Working Gemini cloud fallback
- Knowledge of FG strengths/weaknesses (see `notes/progress-goal1.md`)
